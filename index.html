# # Introduction about project:
# This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil 
# ,##and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show upfor their appointment.\n",
# "#-ScheduledDay: tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.\n",
# "#-Neighborhood: indicates the location of the hospital.\n",
# "#-Scholarship: indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program"

# # First step of data analysis is:
# #### Load Data, assessing, and display some general information about this data such as: shape, columns name, columns dtype, fast lookup about data

# In[2]:


#load data and read csv file
df=pd.read_csv("noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv")

# calling data shape 
df.shape


# In[3]:


# to display info. about columns names and data types
    
print(df.info())


# # Second step : Data cleaning step (Wranling)
# 1- Renaming some column names such as : Hipertension to Hypertension  and No-show to No_show.
# 2- change some columns dtype such as : Patient id from float to int64, SchedualDay and AppointmentDay from object to datetime 
# 3- 6- Extract day and hour from SchedualDay and appointmentDay.
# 4- check duplication.
# 5- check Null values
# 

# In[4]:


#Rename te wrong word (Hipertension) to Hypertension
df.rename(columns={"Hipertension":"Hypertension"},inplace=True)
#rename No-shoe to No_show
df.rename(columns={"No-show":"No_show"},inplace=True)


# In[5]:


# calling column names with first 5 rows to display our data

df.head()


# In[6]:


#Convert PatientId from float64 to int64
df["PatientId"]=df["PatientId"].astype("int64")
# Convert columns type (ScheduledDay and AppointmentDay) from object to datetime64[ns]
df=df.astype({"ScheduledDay":'datetime64[ns]',"AppointmentDay":'datetime64[ns]'})


# In[7]:


#Extract schedul_day from ScheduledDay column
df["Schedul_day"]=df["ScheduledDay"].dt.dayofweek
#Extract Appointment_day from AppointmentDay column
df["Appointment_day"]=df["AppointmentDay"].dt.dayofweek
#Extract schedul_hour from ScheduledDay column
df["Schedual_hour"]=df["ScheduledDay"].dt.hour


# Are there any null values?

# In[8]:


#Sum of cells in each column contains null value 
df.isnull().sum()


# no null values

# In[9]:


df.isnull().count()


# ### Step extract duplication

# In[10]:


#check duplication
df.duplicated().sum()


# Mean, there is no general duplication between columns.Although we will examine if there is any duplication in between certain columns.
# 

# Nice, there is no duplication or null values
# 

# #### Step extract dplication in between columns.

# ###### How many unique patients id?

# In[11]:


#check unique id's
df["PatientId"].nunique()


# This mean 62299 is from 110527 are unique, this mean there are some duplicated ids.

# In[12]:


#check sum of duplicated ids
df["PatientId"].duplicated().sum()


# Number of duplicated ids is 48228,this mean that, one patient id was written more than one time.

# ### step knowing, from where did theses duplication come, and cleaning them.

# Are there duplication come from duplication in(PatientId and appointmentId)?

# In[13]:


#check duplication between PatientId and apoopointment id
df.duplicated(["PatientId","AppointmentID"]).sum()


# There is no sharing between Patient id and appointment id,mean, each patient id has diffrent appointment id

# Are there any duplication between patientId and No_show?

# In[14]:


#check dulication between id and  show status
df.duplicated(["PatientId","No_show"]).sum()


# Opp, this mean that 38710 from 48228 come from duplication in between patient id and showing status. so need to remove them.

# In[15]:


#remove duplicates patientIds with duplicated show state
df.drop_duplicates(['PatientId','No_show'],inplace=True)


# In[16]:


#Recheck dulication between id and  show status
df.duplicated(["PatientId","No_show"]).sum()


# Now, there is no duplication in between PatientId and Show status.

# Check other duplication in between other columns.

# In[17]:


df.duplicated(["PatientId","Diabetes","Hypertension","Handcap","Alcoholism","Scholarship","Neighbourhood"]).sum()


# opp, There are 9518 from 38710 come from duplication inbetween patient id and other columns.

# Are there any duplication between patient id and age?

# In[18]:


df.duplicated(["PatientId","Age","Diabetes","Hypertension","Handcap","Alcoholism","Scholarship","Neighbourhood"]).sum()


# There are 9122 duplication from 9518 due to duplication between patient id and age, mean there is more than one patient has the same age. 

# Are there any duplication in between PatientId and sms recieved?

# In[19]:


#check dulication between id and  SmS recieved
df.duplicated(["PatientId","Diabetes","Hypertension","Handcap","Alcoholism","Scholarship","Neighbourhood","SMS_received"]).sum()


# oop, there are 5394 patient recieved more than one message.
# this mean 5394 from 9518 duplication come from duplication in between patient id and Sms recived.

# Are there duplications between patient id and Appointment day?

# In[20]:


df.duplicated(["PatientId","AppointmentDay"]).sum()


# opp, there are 703 duplication between id and appointment day.

# Are there any duplication between patientid and appointmentDay?

# In[21]:


df.duplicated(["PatientId","ScheduledDay","AppointmentDay"]).sum()


# opp, there ara 17 duplication between ptientid and appointmentday

# ##### Data type after editing

# In[22]:



df.info()


# # Third step : Analyzing data
# 1- summary of general statics shows: count, mean, std, min, max, 25%,50% and 75% of each column.
# 2- 

# In[23]:


# this function to computes a summary of statistics
df.describe()


# ###### From the prevoius static summary, we had a notice that:
# 1- The min. of age is -1, so we will remove it.
# 2- Most of people don't have a scholarship.(75%).
# 3- Most of people (75%) don't have hypertension, diabities, or handcapa and don't drink alcohol.
# 

# In[24]:


#display min age
df["Age"].min()


# In[25]:


# display row index  that contains Age=-1
mask_false_age=df.query('Age==-1')
mask_false_age


# In[26]:


#drop age = -1 index
df.drop(index=99832,inplace=True)


# In[27]:


#Ensure that ae index== -1 was deleted
df.describe()


# nice, min age now becomes = 0 not -1

# How many did patient attend?

# In[28]:


attend=df.No_show=="No" 
df[attend].count()


# There were 54154 from 71817 after dropping duplicated id with No_show cases.

# How many did patients not attend?

# In[29]:


not_attend=df.No_show=="Yes" 
df[not_attend].count()


# There are 17663 patients from 71817 didn't attend.

# What did the most day the patients reserve and take appointment?

# In[30]:


#display the most day of schedul
df["Schedul_day"].value_counts(),df["Schedul_day"].mode()[0]


# In[31]:



    plt.figure(figsize=[16,7])
   
    df["Schedul_day"].value_counts(normalize=True).plot(kind="pie",autopct='%1.1f%%')
    plt.legend();

    plt.title("Comparison between days of Appointment")
    
    plt.ylabel("week's Days")


# From, previous data, we notice that Thurasday(day 1) was the most day of revised and appointment and may this led to some mistake in entering data due to crowdniss in reserving. saturday (day 5) was the least day of resering and appointment, may be dut to weekend.

# # Conclusion:
# ##### 1- 1- The young people were more attending than older ,this mean that the parients take care about their young.
# ##### 2- The older attendenace is least,may be due to low awarness.
# ##### 3- No. of people who received Smss less,but more attendence, so we should recheck smss
# ##### 4- The most gender is : Femal. and this is in women habit. hhhh
# ##### 5-  The most region share in this medical appointment is:  JARDIM CAMBURI , and the minumum region is:  AEROPORTO.
# ##### 6- Almost of attendance who recieved SMSs come from districts with red color more than blue color
# 

# # Limitations:

# ##### No Clear correlation between attendance and chronic diseases and sholarship.
